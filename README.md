# Dual Image Super-Resolution for High-Resolution Optical Satellite Imagery

This project was developed as part of the ISRO Hackathon 2025. It addresses the challenge of enhancing the resolution and visual clarity of satellite imagery using a pipeline that includes pre-processing and deep learning-based super-resolution.

# Problem Statement

Satellite images often suffer from resolution limitations due to sensor constraints or transmission limitations. This project proposes a method to enhance low-resolution satellite images through:

- Shadow detection

- Brightness normalization

- Deep learning-based image super-resolution

# Approach

The pipeline includes the following major stages:

1. Shadow Detection: Adaptive thresholding is applied to grayscale images to isolate shadow regions.

2. Brightness Normalization: Histogram equalization is performed to reduce lighting inconsistencies.

3. Super-Resolution: An ESRGAN-based model (via TensorFlow Hub) is applied to enhance image resolution.

4. Quality Analysis: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) are computed to evaluate output quality.
