\## Dual Image Super-Resolution for Satellite Imagery 



This project was developed for the **ISRO Hackathon 2025** under the challenge:

> \*\*"Dual Image Super-Resolution for High-Resolution Optical Satellite Imagery and Its Blind Evaluation"\*\*



---



\##  Problem Statement



Enhancing satellite image resolution is critical for Earth observation and GIS applications.  

We combine **image pre-processing** and **deep learning-based super-resolution** to reconstruct clearer, high-res images from low-quality satellite inputs.
